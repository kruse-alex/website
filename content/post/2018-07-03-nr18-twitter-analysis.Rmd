I took my oldschool-ish twitter analysis script and gave it a try for the hastag #nr18. nr18 was the Netzwerk Rechercheâ€™s annual conference 2018 which took place on Friday and Saturday 29-30th June at NDR (Northern German Broadcasting) in Hamburg. netzwerk recherche e.V. (nr) is a registered not-for-profit association of journalists founded in 2001. They also had a track on data journalism. Find more info here: https://netzwerkrecherche.org.
