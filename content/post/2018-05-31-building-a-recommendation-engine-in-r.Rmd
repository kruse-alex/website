A product based recommendation engine with the recommenerlab R-package. On <a href="https://github.com/kruse-alex/airrohr">my Github</a> you will find the R code to create product recommendations on a test data set (see product_views.csv). The data file consists of different website visiors with unique user ids and their views of products in an online shop. This is a made up test data file to put the recommendation algorithm into work. The recommenderlab package provides an infrastructure to test and develop recommender algorithms.
