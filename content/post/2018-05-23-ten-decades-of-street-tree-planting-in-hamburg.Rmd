Hamburg is doing great with its <a href="http://transparenz.hamburg.de/">open data platform</a> where you can find a lot of cool data sets to play with. I gave it shot with <a href="http://suche.transparenz.hamburg.de/dataset/strassenbaumkataster-hamburg8?forceWeb=true">ten decades of street tree planting data</a> and made an animated poster-style visualization. It would be awesome not only to get data on tree plantings but also felling. I am in contact with the authorities but it seems quite hard to get on the data. We will see.
