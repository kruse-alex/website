<p>I came across <a href="https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/berlin-marathon-2017/">this cool piece</a> of data vizualization from the folks of Berliner Morgenpost. I thought it would be nice to re-create the whole visualization for the Hamburg Marathon 2018. I came up with a complete R-based solution. The animated visualiaztion itself is made out of multiple ggplot outputs.</p>
