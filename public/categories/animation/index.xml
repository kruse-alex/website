      <description>I came across this cool piece of data vizualization from the folks of Berliner Morgenpost. I thought it would be nice to re-create the whole visualization for the Hamburg Marathon 2018. I came up with a complete R-based solution. The animated visualiaztion itself is made out of multiple ggplot outputs.</description>

      <description>I installed my own open source fine dust sensor on my balcony in September 2017. I build this sensor as part of a bigger citizen science project called luftdaten.info. The data from all fine dust sensors is also available here. By March 2018 I was wondering how many fine dust sensors we have in Hamburg so I created an animated visualization of the project growth in Hamburg. It’s all made with #rstats.</description>
