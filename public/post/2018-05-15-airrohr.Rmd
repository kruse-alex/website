I installed my own open source fine dust sensor on my balcony in September 2017. I build this sensor as part of a bigger citizen science project called <a href="https://luftdaten.info/">luftdaten.info</a>. The data from all fine dust sensors is also available <a href="https://github.com/opendata-stuttgart/meta/wiki/APIs">here</a>. By March 2018 I was wondering how many fine dust sensors we have in Hamburg so I created an animated visualization of the project growth in Hamburg.

I created another animated visualization to compare the project growth in German cities with more than 50 fine dust sensors.

Both visualization are done with R and you can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/kruse-alex/airrohr">my Github</a>.
